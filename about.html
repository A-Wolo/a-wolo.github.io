<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Andrew Wolowicz and I am a student majoring in computer science at URI. I was born and raised in the<br>
best city in Rhode Island--Pawtucket, but I went to high school in Warwick. I have previously held jobs at CVS and the Department<br>
of Public Works in Pawtucket. I'm the oldest of three siblings, and my family has always been very important to me. My hobbies include <br>
working out, watching the Patriots, reading, and of course, programming my little heart out.</p>
